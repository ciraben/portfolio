another time i joined a game jam and made a screensaver rogue-like.
it's like the old windows 3.1 "flying windows" screensaver, but you smash the windows to progress.
i built this in react and learned a lot in the process.
you can [**play it here**](https://ciraben.github.io/webhack/) or [**view source code here**](https://github.com/ciraben/webhack).
