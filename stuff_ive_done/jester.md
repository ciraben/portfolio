## jester

one time i joined a game jam with my girlfriend and we made a cute game together.
you're a jester and you play mini-games for the entertainment of your king.
we developed our game in python with the arcade library.
it included graphics she drew, music i played on piano, and controller support. you can find [**screenshots here**](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/jester-4-1) and [**source code here**](https://github.com/ciraben/jester).
