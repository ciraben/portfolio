## thrill jockey

recently i helped develop an e-commerce store for american record label [**Thrill Jockey**](https://www.thrilljockey.com/index).
their sizeable product catalog consists mostly of vinyl records and audio files.
this project was built from scratch with rails, solidus and typescript for site functionality, and tailwind for styling.
