## victoria soundscape

recently i joined a game jam and made a short text adventure in rails.
i gathered audio footage in victoria and built an explorable [**directed graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) of the soundscapes i recorded.
i used [**turbo frames**](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) to sneakily autoplay clips in the browser.
you can find [**source code here**](https://github.com/ciraben/orca24).
