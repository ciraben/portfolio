## vines

one time i helped the [**VINES art festival**](https://www.vinesartsociety.com/about-us) in vancouver launch an augmented reality (AR) exhibit about native plants and animals.
i updated their website, coordinated with modellers, and ensured that visitors could scan QR codes to view AR exhibits through their phone cams.
