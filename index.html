jaz makes sweet art and is an all around great person to work with.

              <h2>jester</h2>
<p>one time i joined a game jam with my girlfriend and we made a cute game together.
you're a jester and you play mini-games for the entertainment of your king.
we developed our game in python with the arcade library.
it included graphics she drew, music i played on piano, and controller support. you can find <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/jester-4-1"><strong>screenshots here</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ciraben/jester"><strong>source code here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>one time i made <a href="https://ciraben.github.io/stiritup/"><strong>a site mockup</strong></a> for a restaurant i like.
the owner is super kind and shared some of her brand assets for me to include.
i used jekyll and bootstrap to set it up - <a href="https://github.com/ciraben/stiritup"><strong>source code here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>recently i helped develop an e-commerce store for american record label <a href="https://www.thrilljockey.com/index"><strong>Thrill Jockey</strong></a>.
their sizeable product catalog consists mostly of vinyl records and mp3s.

              <h2>victoria soundscape</h2>
<p>one time i joined a game jam and made a short text adventure in rails.
i gathered audio footage in victoria and built an explorable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph"><strong>directed graph</strong></a> of the soundscapes i recorded.
i used <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/"><strong>turbo frames</strong></a> to sneakily autoplay audio clips in the browser.

              <h2>webhack</h2>
<p>another time i joined a game jam and made a screensaver rogue-like.
it's like the windows 3.1 &quot;flying windows&quot; screensaver, but you smash the windows to progress.
i built this in react and learned a lot in the process.
